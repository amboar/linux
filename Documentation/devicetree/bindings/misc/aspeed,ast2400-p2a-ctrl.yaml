description: |
  The P2A bridge is available on platforms with the VGA enabled on the Aspeed
  device. In this case, the host has access to a relocatable 64KiB window into
  the BMC's physical address space. However, the BMC can disable this bridge.
  If the bridge is enabled, the host has read access to all regions of memory,
  however the host only write access to a defined set of regions controlled by
  the BMC.
