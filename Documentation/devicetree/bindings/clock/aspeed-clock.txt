Device Tree Clock bindings for the Aspeed AST2400

Aspeed SoCs have a fixed frequency input osciallator is usd to create the PLL
and APB clocks. We can determine these frequencies by reading registers that
are set according to strapping bits.

PLL:

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "aspeed,ast2400-pll-clock"
- #clock-cells : Should be 0
- reg : Should contain registers location and length
- clocks : Should contain phandle + clock-specifier for the input clock

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names : Should contain clock name


APB:

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "aspeed,ast2400-apb-clock"
- #clock-cells : Should be 0
- reg : Should contain registers location and length
- clocks : Should contain phandle + clock-specifier for the the pll

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names : Should contain clock name


For example:

	clk_hpll: clk_hpll {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-pll-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x1e6e2008 0x4>;
	};

	clk_apb: clk_apb@1e6e2008 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-apb-clock";
		reg = <0x1e6e2008 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk_hpll>;
	};
